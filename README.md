# Blog Web App Using EJS

## Project Overview
This project is a dynamic blog web application built using **EJS (Embedded JavaScript)** as the templating engine. The application enables users to create, view, and manage blog posts interactively. EJS will handle the rendering of HTML templates dynamically based on the data provided.

## Key Features
- **Dynamic Templates:** Use EJS for generating HTML pages dynamically.
- **Blog Management:** Users can create, view, and delete blog posts.
- **Server-Side Rendering:** EJS templates are rendered on the server for better performance and SEO.
- **RESTful Routing:** The application will implement RESTful routes for seamless navigation.

## Technologies Used
- **EJS**: A lightweight templating engine for creating dynamic HTML templates.
- **Node.js**: For building the server-side application logic.
- **Express.js**: For handling routing and middleware.
- **CSS/Bootstrap**: For styling and enhancing the user interface.
